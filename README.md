# Revenue Early-Warning Analytics System

## Problem Statement
Companies often detect revenue loss too late — after churn or conversion drops already impact financial reports.  
This project builds an analytics system to identify early warning signals that indicate potential revenue risk.

## Business Goal
Reduce decision latency by enabling early detection of churn, conversion decline, and regional underperformance.

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Business-first analytics thinking
- End-to-end data and analytics engineering
- Metrics design and data trust
- Executive-ready insight
